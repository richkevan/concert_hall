Concert Hall is my personal adaption of the classic JavaScript project drum kit. I turned it into a single piano scale with a styled concert hall background and keys.

Planned Project enhancements.

1. Add media queries and a mobile version with touch events.
2. Expand desktop version to more keys
3. Add instrument variations
